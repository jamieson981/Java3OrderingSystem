DAILY SCRUM - EVERY DAY AT 9AM
------------------------------

<< Each member writes down answers to 3 questions: >>

1. What I have done / not done since last Scrum?
2. What I plan to do from this scrum to the next? (next 24 hours)
3. Where do I need assistance? What do I need to figure out?
